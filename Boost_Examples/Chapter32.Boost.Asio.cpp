/*
	Boost.Asio stands for asynchronous input/output.This library make sit possible to process data asynchronously.

	Asynchronous means that when operations are initiated, the initiating program does not need to wait for the operation to end.Instead, Boost.Asio notifies a program when an operation has ended.

	Boost.Thread is another library that makes it possible to execute operations concurrently.

	The difference between Boost.Thread and Boost.Asio is that will Boost.Thread, you access resources inside of a program, and with Boost.Asio, you access resources outside of a program.

	Threads allow you to access and use CPU cores. CPU cores are an internal resource. If you want to access external resources. you use Boost.Asio

	Boost.Asio allows you to use the available devices more efficiently by benifiting from their ability to execute operations concurrently

	Sending and receiving data over a network is implemented as an asynchronous operation in Boost.Asio.Think of an asynchronous operation as a function that
	immediately returns, but without ant result. The result is handed over later.
